public class PromptGenerator
/*
Supplies random prompts whenever needed 
(ie: when a new entry begins). This class will draw from a list of
prompts created by the author (Kathleen Rivera), but could be edited
to eventually draw prompts from an outside source.
Because I have created this class, if I decide one day to 
draw prompts from an outside source, such as a webpage, I would
only need to alter this class rather than more code from other classes
if I had just made this a method instead of a class. Saves work later.
